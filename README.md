# Taurus
The Taurus Project is a collection of tools and libraries made for the Taurus Programming Language (TRS) and the Taurus Scripting Language (TRSS). All tools strive to be as independent as my knowledge will allow.

## Fundamentals
<ul>
  <li><b>No syntax sugar</b> - will make the code more readable</li>
  <li><b>No compiller's magic</b> - will allow the porgrammer to have more control on what is realy going on and what the compiller is doing</li>
  <li><b>Uniform syntax</b> - one operator always means the same</li>
  <li><b>Trust</b> - TRS and TRSS are not made for beginners! They can give you good results or headache</li>
</ul>

## Everything is subject to change
I am open to suggestions and objective criticism. This project is created for me and it has to meet my requirements in the first place, but I also create it because I want to learn more, so my approach, assumptions and solutions may change. Any feetback is welcome.
